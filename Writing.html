<h1>Welcome to Abdirahman's page</h1>
<p>Hi I'm Abdirahman Mahamud. I am 24 years old and interested in technology, programming and AI. Inspired by the #100dayofcode, I decided to try my hand at HTML, CSS and Javascript.</p>
<h1>My goal for this blog</h1>
<p>I plan to log my programming journey and share any insights i learn along the way. Hopefully, this can help others who may be interested in programming.</p>
<h2>My links</h2>
<p>I just made a <a href="https://github.com/AbdirahmanMahamud/Abdirahman.So">Github</a> , where i will update this <a href="file:///Users/abdirahmanmahamud/Index.html"</a>website.</a></p>
<p>Here's a link to my blog <a href="https://wordpress.com/posts/abdirahmanmahamud.wordpress.com">blog.</a> </p>
